//! The TLV structure uses a tag or base address to identify segments of the 
//! table where information is stored. Some examples of TLV tags are Peripheral 
//! Descriptor, Interrupts, Info Block and Die Record. This function retrieves 
//! the value of a tag and the length of the tag.
//!
//! \param tag represents the tag for which the information needs to be 
//! retrieved. Various tags such as ADC (TLV_TAG_ADCCAL), Peripheral Descriptor 
//! (TLV_TAG_PDTAG) are defined in the tlv.h file.
//! \param instance - In some cases a specific tag may have more than one 
//! instance. For example there may be multiple instances of timer calibration 
//! data present under a single Timer Cal tag. This variable specifies the 
//! instance for which information is to be retrieved (0, 1, etc.). When 
//! only one instance exists; 0 is passed.
//! \param *length acts as a return through indirect reference. The function 
//! retrieves the value of the TLV tag length. This value is pointed to by 
//! *length and can be used by the application level once the function is 
//! called. If the specified tag is not found then the pointer is null 0.
//! \param **data_address acts as a return through indirect reference. Once the 
//! function is called data_address points to the pointer that holds the values
//! retrieved from the specified TLV tag. If the specified tag is not found 
//! then the pointer is null 0.
//!
//! \returns None
